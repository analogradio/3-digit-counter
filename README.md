# 3-digit-counter
17-bit serial-in/parallel-out shift register drives 17 LEDs (`left[7:0]`, `red`, `right[7:0]`) by shifting in 1s and clearing when all bits are 1. The MSB LED (`left[7]`) clocks three cascaded 4-bit decade counters to form a 000–999 decimal up-counter. The count is displayed on three 7-segment displays: `ss0` = ones, `ss1` = tens, `ss2` = hundreds, with leading-zero suppression on tens and hundreds.
